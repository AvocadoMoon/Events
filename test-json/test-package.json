            "defaultDescription": "The Stonington Farmers Market began in 1997 under the initiative of Geoffrey Little. The enormously popular market attracts residents from the Borough and surrounding communities who come to buy fresh, healthy, local food. In 2008, the Stonington Farmers Market became a year-round event on Saturdays, moving inside during the winter months.\n\n \n\nItems sold at the market include locally grown vegetables and fruits, jams, a variety of breads, pies and baked goods, cheese, eggs, poultry, meat, seafood, Italian ices, maple syrup, honey, and flowers. Thanks to greenhouses, our farmers are able to offer a selection of fresh produce throughout the winter. Our market offers whatever our farmers are harvesting each week as well as prepared foods such as salsa, soups, meat pies, hummus, breakfast sandwiches, and baked goods.\n\n\nIn addition to great food, different craft vendors are featured each week at the market. Among the hand-made items you will find are beautiful candles, pottery, jewelry, wooden bowls, cutting boards, soaps, gorgeous note cards, and table linens.",
